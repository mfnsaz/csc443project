# CSC443 Project - UiTM Club Activities Application System
CSC443 final project. Using the XAMP stack (X for the OS (Windows, Linux), A for Apache, M for MySQL, and P for PHP) to build a club activities application system.

## Installation
There are several steps you must take in order to setup this system in your system.

### Cloning the repository
You can clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/mnfsaz/csc443project`

### Setting up the Database
Install MySQL and optionally PHPMyAdmin. Then, run the SQL file located in the SQL subfolder.

### Setting up database credentials
The database credentials example file can be found at `.ini.example`. If you wish to use them, copy or rename the file to `.ini` and modify the database username and password.

### Setting up first Admin account
Currently, there are no ways to create the first administrator account. You must use MySQL command line or PHPMyAdmin to create your first admin account. In the future, we will provide a default account in the database sql.
